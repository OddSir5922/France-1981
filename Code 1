Mitterrand is expanding his momentum after challenging Giscard’s tone after a debate, which has left an impression on viewers across the nation with color TV sets at home. The average French voter feels exhausted by inflation and the recent job losses, which has clearly been eating away at Giscard’s public image. Mitterrand offers a new path by promising greater public control over France's largest industries. The Place de la Bastille awaits to erupt in a celebration if Mitterrand pulls off a win or a widespread protest if d'Estaing upsets the majority of Paris.</p>",

With the socialistic glamour of a philosopher and the patience of a saint, Mitterrand is like your favourite vintage bottle of champagne that occasionally gives you a headache in Burgundy. This time, he garuntees changes within his own views with a slow and contemplative wink as if he’s been planning this all along in a chess game that only he understands. Mitterrand is the only candidate who quotes poetry at his rallies and still manages to sound threatening to the rich. While his opponent is handing out clichés just as much as he hands out baguettes, Mitterrand is out there rewriting the rules of French campaigns forever. So if you're tired of flashy promises and want a president who smolders with socialist intensity, François Mitterrand is your très chic revolution.",

However, his perceived aloofness\nhas sometimes distanced him from the average voter. Giscard d'Estaing stands as the president of paradox: a forward-thinking liberal\nwrapped in the same traditions of old-world elegance. In this election, the Socialist Party will be labeling him as a conservative flip-flopper to their advantage.",
